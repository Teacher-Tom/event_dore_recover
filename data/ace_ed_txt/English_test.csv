The extraordinary sandstorms, the bitter cold nights. The most uncomfortable thing is having to sleep sitting up in a Humvee with sandbags under your feet, your knees at your chin. That's excruciatingly uncomfortable, not something that you would wish on anybody but a contortionist. Let me give you an example of what the dust like. Look at this.

The informant offered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be used in the genocide campaign. All that the informant wanted in return was protection for himself and his family. But the general needed U.N. authorization to conduct such a raid and save lives. He asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now-infamous ""genocide fax"" from Annan's office.

68,"Japan continued a policy of acquiring territory for some grand, illusive scheme of a ""Greater Asia"", subordinate and grateful to Japan. The reality of this was that only a single possession, Manchuria, was profitable to the Japanese, and the rest of the Empire turned out to be a drain. This drain was greatly accelerated by Japan's invasion of China proper in 1936. It was a war that Japan assumed would be ended in ""3 to 6 months""; at the time of Pearl Harbor, it had been going on for 5 years, at the cost of over half a million Japanese lives. The war put a tremendous strain on Japan (and was in fact opposed by more radically NATIONALISTIC elements, as taking away from the development of Japan's other possessions, particularly in the areas of scrap metal and fuel.) Domestic consumption fell, consumer goods became scarce, and the use of materiale for war purposes ate into Japan's domestic industry. This cut further into her foreign reserves, exacerbating the economic impact of the war. The war effort took on a life of its own, however, and common sense was subordinated to it. Japan expanded into areas of China and Indochina which had no strategic value to her, but put her in a position to threaten British and Dutch possessions in the area; possessions that both those Allied nations needed in order to continue their fight against Hitler. At this point, the US stopped ignoring the Japanese threat, and imposed a series of escalating sanctions on Japan, cutting off her scrap metal, limitting and then cutting off her oil (Japan imported most of both from the US.) While Japanese officials realized that they had enough of each resource for Japan to do well IF THE WAR IN CHINA STOPPED, they were powerless over the military they were supposed to control. An abortive attack on Soviet positions in Mongolia had placed Japan's focus firmly south, towards the possessions of the US' future allies. For no reason anyone could articulate, Japan felt she had to continue the war in China. To continue the war in China, she had to have resources of oil and metal. To have these resources, she must seize them, if others refused to sell them. In order to seize them, she felt she had to attack and destroy the naval power of the US.",cost,1,1761
