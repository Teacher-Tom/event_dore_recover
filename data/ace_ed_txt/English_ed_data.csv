Even as the secretary of homeland security was putting his people on high alert last month, a 30-foot Cuban patrol boat with four heavily armed men landed on American shores, utterly undetected by the Coast Guard Secretary Ridge now leads. Now, why has our president placed homeland security in the hands of Republican political hacks instead of professionals, by the way",landed,Transport
1,"Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example, is a career politician. He lost an election to a dead man. Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge is another career politician who was passed over by Mr. Bush for the vice presidency.

Apparently, Mr. Bush only turns to professionals when it's really important, like political consulting.",election,Elect

Now in your administration, the Clinton administration, there were these members of the cabinet who by your definition were professional politicians -- Lloyd Bentsen, Les Aspin, William S. Cohen, Janet Reno, Bruce Babbitt, Mike Espy, Dan Glickman, Norman Mineta, Henry Cisneros, Federico Pena, Bill Richardson, Richard Riley, 12 of them, not to mention former Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, and one of the great professional politicians of all time, Bill Daly.",elected,Elect

In all, two million Americans have lost their jobs under President Bush so far, not to mention three of them being the top three leaders of his economic team. Meanwhile, the deficit now at $300 billion. It could swell to as much as $500 billion if we go to war in Iraq. Mr. Bush apparently is untroubled by this fiscal collapse.

9,"Bob, one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about this war and so many people around the world don't want to go is there have been a lot of problems with credibility from this administration. Our president has repeatedly, for example, relied on a man whom you're aware, Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, leader of the Iraq arms program who defected for a time. And gave us a whole lot of information and then went home and his father-in-law killed him. Bad move. But while he was here, he gave us a whole lot of information. Gave us a whole lot of information. Well, our president told us that information proves that the dictator had chemical weapons, which is true.

Why hasn't our president told us that",killed,Die

Bush isn't sitting in that White House not thinking about the body bags coming home with great young men. Clinton suffered greatly over the 19 Rangers that died, 18 on the 3rd of October and Matt Reersen (ph) three days later. I visited all their families. I was at the medal of honor ceremony for the kids. Let me tell you, what trips to Walter Reed taught me was, that whoever thought up the term, the law of unintended consequences it pertains to war.

You can have a general question like this that could mean anything and ask people and they give you what comes off the top of their head. But, ask them another question, ask them what they think about spending $1.3 trillion in destroying this economy. Ask them about going and not just a war, Bob, but an invasion and occupying for up to 10 years a sovereign Arab nation in the midst of one of the most distable and volatile regions in the world. Ask them how they feel about getting bogged down. Well, I've seen some of the figures. Once you start telling Americans the story, -- the administration refuse today tell us story. They're not coming forward and telling us what the risks are, what the costs are, how many years we might be in, the possibility of us getting bogged down, because what Americans know that, they're opposed to this war.

And so they're jacking up the rates on a few key specialties like obstetricians and neurosurgeons.

Are we going to allow severely injured people who have found a lung taken out that's the wrong lung or a double mastectomy that wasn't indicated that was inflicted on a woman in the Midwest, or that organ transplant that was incompatible on that 17-year-old teenager in North Carolina.

30,"Well, the current medical liability system is affecting patients in that they can't get access to care. The American Medical Association works very hard to make safety a priority in the medical care system. That's why we founded the National Patient Safety Foundation. The current system doesn't measure negligence. It measures disability. And what we're finding now is that the emergency rooms are closing, trauma centers are closing, pregnant women can't find a doctor to deliver the baby, a boy knocked unconscious has to be transported to another state. Another witness today told of what happened to her husband because there were no longer neurosurgeons available in the community. The patient had to be airavacked and by that time it was too late to prevent the brain damage.",closing,End-Org

What we need is a system that's fair to everyone, a system that keeps the physicians in practice and allows patients to have access to physicians in their hour of need.

I mean, you've got 5 percent of the doctors accounting for over 55 percent of the payoffs, Paul. In other words a small percentage of doctors that are bad, incompetent, indifferent, whatever. They're not performing properly and the AMA is not cracking down, is not supporting expansion to state licensing...",payouts,Fine
34,"I want to respond to that. The National Practitioner Data Bank is the source of the information and it was brought up today. First of all, the Government Accounting Office criticized the methodology used. It lists multiple claims against one physician when actually it's really one claim, different insurers pay on the same physician and it's counted as one claim. It doesn't mention whether they are obstetricians, neurosurgeons or emergency medicine. It doesn't list that. Right now in South Florida, in South Florida, the latest poll shows that every neurosurgeon has been sued. The average number of suits against a neurosurgeon is five in South Florida. Now are these bad doctors",claims,Sue

Let me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else's lawsuits, but instead focus on his own experience. He was the governor of my state of Texas, where there are a whole lot of doctors. It turns out that he didn't do any kind of a job policing your profession at all when he was the governor of Texas. Here's what the ""Dallas Morning News"" reported recently: ""The Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, the agency that pledges to protect the public has granted second and third chances to surgeons who are thrown out of hospitals because they botched operations. It has forgiven physicians who overlook cancerous tumors, who maimed infants or whose mistakes left women sterilized. It has refused in the last five years to revoke the license of a single doctor for committing medical errors. Thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade."" That is the Bush record in policing surgeons, why should we trust him now",lawsuit,Sue

Because someone pays money in a case, the insurance company may pay money because they're afraid there's is going to be a giant award in this case because of this broken liability system. Troy Brennan (ph) of Harvard said there's no correlation with negligence, only with disability.

And the entire pay-out to all of the victims that get a little money, not the 90 percent who never file a claim, amounts to less than what we spend on dog food. On dog food.

A man driving what appeared to be a taxicab came to the checkpoint, waved soldiers over, appeared to be having mechanical problems of some kind. As the soldiers approached, the man detonated explosives in the car killing all four of the soldiers. This is something that Iraqi Vice President Ramadan had said would take place. He said this long before the conflict ever began. He reiterated today in a press conference in Baghdad that this would just be the beginning of this that they would plan on killing thousands of U.S. troops with suicide bombing similar to this. Also, in southern Iraq today near Basra, two members - claimed to be members of Saddam's Thataeen (ph) group surrendered to U.S. troops saying that they had been ordered to carry out suicide bombings down there but that they didn't want to die for the regime so they were surrendering. At the Pentagon briefing today, General Stanley McChrystal said that it looked a lot like terrorism.",bombing,Attack

Tomahawk land detect missiles being from launched from ships in the eastern Mediterranean and in the Red Sea have suffered a number of failures.

The missiles are programmed so that they don't detonate until they reach their target. If they go astray, then the warheads never arm but claiming that it's about one percent of the warheads. They've fired 675 or so tomahawk land detect missiles from ships and seven of those have failed. Judy ...",injuries,Injure
131,"Well, no major concern. The Pentagon says that they do have air dominance as they now call it over the vast majority of the country that there are certain areas and only certain areas of downtown Iraq where battle management radars linked to surface to air missiles are still in tact. The reason that they're still in tact according to today's briefing was that they had not turned them on and as long as they don't turn them on, the U.S. has trouble locating them. They assure us that as soon as they do start turning on these radars that they'll take those out too and finish the job in terms of airspace over Baghdad.Judy ...",battle,Attack

The story the last few days has been the surprising level of resistance but you're telling me your sense is that the coalition forces are beginning to adjust to that.",resistance,Attack
136,"Absolutely. One of the things I think we're likely to see is that the Iraqis are going to have a tougher time adapting than U.S. forces are. Typically what you've seen in the Iraqi armed forces is the change has to come from the top. It doesn't come from the ground up. You don't have ground commanders calling back and saying hey, we'd like to try this tactic or this seems to work. Tell everybody else to do the same thing. Instead the high command has to identify a problem, come up with a solution and transmit it down. Chances are the Iraqis are going to continue to stick with what we've seen before, irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack U.S. forces, some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops. There's no way around that but U.S. forces, British forces are beginning to adapt to it.",attack,Attack
137,"All right. Well, this is something that we've been trying to get a grip on for years, exactly what the Iraqi people feel and also that I think the best evidence that we had before the attack began was that Iraqis do, they despise. They are desperate to be rid of him but by the same token, they don't like another country coming into their country to overturn the government and beyond that, I think it's probably most important for most Iraqis is they're deeply suspicious of the United States. They remember that the United States betrayed them in 1991. The U.S. didn't finish Saddam then. President Bush - then President Bush called on them to rise up and then the U.S. did nothing and so they're deeply suspicious of what we have in mind.",attack,Attack

161,"Hi, Judy. Thank you very much. As of an hour or so ago, we got word from the battlefield that U.S. forces were just 15 miles away from the southern edge of Baghdad. And they may be even closer right now. The toughest fight, though, may lie ahead in the heart of the Iraqi capital. Pentagon sources say the first phase of the final push into Baghdad is now under way. U.S.-led forces were able to press farther north after defeating Iraqi Republican Guard units at Karbala and Kut (ph). Our embedded reporters say the two-pronged advance appears to be moving faster than commanders expected. The Pentagon says two of the Republican Guard divisions defending Baghdad are no longer credible forces. Scenes from Najaf may also be bolstering the troops' spirit. Iraqis who initially were cautious when U.S. forces arrived in Najaf ended cheering them on, shaking their hands and patting their backs. U.S. Army's 7th Cavalry is in the forefront of U.S. troops since they first left Kuwait and crossed directly into the Iraqi desert. Our Walter Rodgers is embedded with the unit's 3rd Squadron, which is leading the 3rd Infantry Division's march toward the Iraqi capital.",crossed,Transport

Indeed, all the arrows on the Army's map seem to be pointing in the direction of the southern suburbs of Baghdad. Earlier in the day, the 1st Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division took Karbala with a minimum of fight. And then the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division secured the town of Karbala. Additionally, the 7th Cavalry has pushed onward in the general direction of Baghdad. Yesterday we were about 50 miles from the southern suburbs of Baghdad. We have perhaps have that distance. Throughout the day, we have watched the 3rd Infantry Division bring in prisoners of war. Iraqi soldiers glad the war is over for them, perhaps 100 at a time. There were times when the 7th Cavalry itself got into some skirmishes as it pushed forward, again in the direction of Baghdad. There was a bit of a firefight when the 7th Cavalry came upon three Soviet vintage 20- millimeter anti-aircraft guns, ack-ack guns. The Iraqi unit in possession of those guns fired mortars in the direction of the 7th Cavalry. The Apache troop opened its tank guns, opened its own mortars, decimated that unit, put it out of existence and probably killed some 20 Iraqis in the process.

They met lighter than expected resistance.

That said, the armored fighting vehicles that you see there they look to me as if they're moving a little bit faster as than we probably will. We'll use patience and finesse. We will take the time to locate the enemy, surround the blocks and the buildings that he is in.

Well, at least three U.S. service members were killed today in an apparent suicide bomb attack at a checkpoint near the Haditah Dam northwest of Baghdad. Those deaths are not yet included in the official casualty count. At last report, though, 41 Americans had been killed by hostile forces, 13 others by friendly fire or in accidents. Of the 27 British troops, in all who have been killed, at least 19 of them were said to be victims of friendly fire or accidents. The official Iraqi casualty figures remain the same this day, including more than 400 civilians killed, Iraqi authorities say. And U.S. Central Command says more than 4,000 Iraqis have been captured, but British officials believe that figure is much higher. We know that seven Americans are known to be held as prisoner of war in Iraq. Another 15 Americans listed as missing in action. Well, funeral services were held today in Colorado for 21-year- old Marine Corporal Randall Kent Rosacker. He was killed in action in Iraq. His story is especially poignant. His father is a navy commander. He received word of his son's death within hours after the submarine that he was assigned to returned home from an extended deployment.

[ applause ]d the extra $400 per child to american families this year, 2003. all together these tax reductions will help 92 million americans. and a significant part of the benefit to our economy will come within the first two years of the plan. a family of four with an income of $40,000 would receive a 96% reduction in federal income taxes. instead of paying $1,178 per year, the family would pay $45 a year. [ applause ] that means extra money in the family budget year after year. that money can cover a lot of bills. that money can help families with purchases they have been delaying. that money will be in circulation, which will be good for our economy. [ applause ] and this plan will help our small business sector. the benefits of the growth plan will come from uncreased consumer spending and, as importantly, from a lower income tax rates on the small businesses themselves. it is important for our fellow citizens to understand that most small businesses pay their business taxes at the individual rates. most small businesses are sole proprietorships, limited partnerships, are subchapter ss, and, therefore, when you reduce individual tax rates, you benefit small business formation. as a matter of fact, under this plan, some 23 million small business owners will see their taxes cut. which leaves more money for investment, more money for growth, more money for job creation. a growing economy also needs small business investment. and our tax code should encourage investment. today a small business can deduct a maximum of $25,000 in the year in which they buy equipment. we need to triple the amount that can be deducted in the year in which they buy equipment. [ applause ] so i propose to congress that they ought to limit -- limit ought to be increased to $75,000 and that limit ought to be indexed to inflation. by doing so, we promote greater investment in machinery. and when a small business bias machine that enhances their company's product divty as well as it means machinery manufacturer is likely to have more work available. more investment equals jobs. and what we are interested in in this administration is helping people who look for work find a job. [ applause ] we can also promote economic growth and job creation by removing the double tax on dividends. [ applause ] taxing corporate income once is fair. it is not fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice. the burden of double taxation falls on the millions of individuals who receive dividends. falls especially hard on seniors who receive half of all dividend income. removal of double taxation would put more money in the hands of investors. it would encourage more investment in american businesses. economists say that this plan will help our stock markets, and since half of american families own stock, the reform will help them save and help our economy grow. now, these measures were presented to congress in the first week of this year. the pro growth package was urgent in january. it's even more urgent today. [ applause ] it is important for you all to understand and for our fellow americans to understand the tax relief that i have proposed and will push for until enacted would create -- [ applause ] will create 1.4 million new jobs by the end of 2004. in two years time, this nation has experienced war, a recession and a national emergency. which has caused our government to run a deficit. the best way to reduce the deficit is with more growth in our economy, which means more revenues to our treasury, and less spending in washington, d.c. [ applause ] i am pleased that both the house and senate have passed budget resolutions that show real spending restraint. and now the congress must focus on a robust and effective growth package. we need at least $550 billion in that package because the more tax relief that goes to the american people, the more jobs we will create in this economy. [ applause ] the last few months have been a time of challenge for america. our resolve has been tested. yet we have the great resources of national strength. and national character. to overcome every challenge we face. our confidence an our optimism have never waivered. we are defending the peace of the world. we're bringing freedom to corners of the world who haven't seen freedom in years. we're all building the prosperity of our country. this is a unique moment in our history and the american people are rising to meet it. i want to thank each of you for your hard work. i want to thank each of you for the faith you have shown in this country's future. may god bless you, and may god continue to bless america.

655,"right. well, first of all, the spacecraft would not be launched from earth. you'd have to launch is from in space already, which means we would have to build it in space. so that means we need a good shuttle that's going to take us back and forth to build the spacecraft. then we have to come up with the fuel that will take it out of the earth's orbit all the way to mars. that's probably going to be nuclear propulsion at this point again something we haven't really developed yet, because we couldn't carry that much fuel, obviously. liquid oxygen would be way too heavy to carry all the way to mars. the bigger issue is once we get there, we can't carry oxygen or water or food to stay there three years, so we're going to have to do all of that on the surface of the planet. and think of it. mars is carbon dioxide. so we can't breathe there. so we're going to have to come up with some conversion technique to create water, to create oxygen and then some way of growing food on the planet itself. all of this is in the works now, but i think it's going to take quite a few years to develop it.",launched,Transport

A thicker-than-usual issue of the Roundup would be filled with accusations from both factions in the group each accusing the other of improper behavior. Swenson herself would also leave the NCA. Not much later, she began publishing her own magazine called ""Carousel Art"", which was essentially a scholarly photo album depicting different carvers and styles each month.

1760,"This line of reasoning seems to derive from arguments that Japan was being ""driven into a corner"" by sanctions, and had no choice but to attack the US. Meiji Japan was driven to emulate what it thought the West was doing in every facet of society. They had observed, for example, that the West was able to carve up China into ""Spheres of Influence"", and was able to do from great distances, while they, the Japanese, had had limited success in their previous attempts to dominate the Korean peninsula, much less China. As part of the catch-up effort, she whole-heartedly entered into the Imperialist game in Asia, being treated as an equal (relative to her power) by the other powers. However, after World War I, Japan failed to recognize a fundamental shift in the attitudes of her former Imperial partners; they began a long, slow process of disengaging themselves from their former Imperial areas, from their colonies, in addition to outright stopping all expansions. Japan chose to read this as a sign that the West had lost its power and resolve, and that Japan was the rightful heir to Imperial mantle in Asia. With the deaths of many of the idealistic leaders who had led Japan's rise to international prominence, and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs, in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions from Germany, Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive Japan in the area. Having a keen grasp of the obvious, she began a policy of acceding to Japanese hegemony in the area.",stripping,Fine
1761,"Japan continued a policy of acquiring territory for some grand, illusive scheme of a ""Greater Asia"", subordinate and grateful to Japan. The reality of this was that only a single possession, Manchuria, was profitable to the Japanese, and the rest of the Empire turned out to be a drain. This drain was greatly accelerated by Japan's invasion of China proper in 1936. It was a war that Japan assumed would be ended in ""3 to 6 months""; at the time of Pearl Harbor, it had been going on for 5 years, at the cost of over half a million Japanese lives. The war put a tremendous strain on Japan (and was in fact opposed by more radically NATIONALISTIC elements, as taking away from the development of Japan's other possessions, particularly in the areas of scrap metal and fuel.) Domestic consumption fell, consumer goods became scarce, and the use of materiale for war purposes ate into Japan's domestic industry. This cut further into her foreign reserves, exacerbating the economic impact of the war. The war effort took on a life of its own, however, and common sense was subordinated to it. Japan expanded into areas of China and Indochina which had no strategic value to her, but put her in a position to threaten British and Dutch possessions in the area; possessions that both those Allied nations needed in order to continue their fight against Hitler. At this point, the US stopped ignoring the Japanese threat, and imposed a series of escalating sanctions on Japan, cutting off her scrap metal, limitting and then cutting off her oil (Japan imported most of both from the US.) While Japanese officials realized that they had enough of each resource for Japan to do well IF THE WAR IN CHINA STOPPED, they were powerless over the military they were supposed to control. An abortive attack on Soviet positions in Mongolia had placed Japan's focus firmly south, towards the possessions of the US' future allies. For no reason anyone could articulate, Japan felt she had to continue the war in China. To continue the war in China, she had to have resources of oil and metal. To have these resources, she must seize them, if others refused to sell them. In order to seize them, she felt she had to attack and destroy the naval power of the US.",cost,Die

Most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mitigate this threat. Instead, a menu of options may be considered, including installing infrared (IR) countermeasures on aircraft; modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures; improving airport and regional security; and strengthening missile non-proliferation efforts. Equipping aircraft with missile countermeasure systems can protect the aircraft even when operating in areas where ground-based security measures are unavailable or infeasible to implement. However, this option has a relatively high cost, between $1 million and $3 million per aircraft, and the time needed for implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing terrorist threat. Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training, altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks. However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports.",attacks,Attack

Actually, the pro-U.N. lobby paid for it. In a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight news reporter, Fasulo acknowledges Ted Turner's U.N.

The book is about ""one of the finest and most important governing bodies,"" she says. Of the U.N. chief, she writes like a school girl with a crush.

Another endorsement of the book comes from Barbara Crossette, former New York Times bureau chief at the U.N. who now writes for U.N. Wire, a Ted Turner-funded online news service that covers the U.N.

The informant offered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be used in the genocide campaign. All that the informant wanted in return was protection for himself and his family. But the general needed U.N. authorization to conduct such a raid and save lives. He asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now-infamous ""genocide fax"" from Annan's office. It denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide",genocide,Attack

It's true, Hentoff said, that the U.N. issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged, to some extent, its role in the killings.
