Corpsmen quickly take patients by ambulance away from the blowing sand to a triage tent. It is there the doctors begin their work. Over 45 minutes as we watched, 32 patients were delivered here, evaluated and nine operations started; 29 of those delivered, Marines involved in a firefight in the center of Baghdad.

Some senators represent people pools that are in turn fractured into five or six House districts. I believe this accounts, in large part, for the dysfunction that characterizes our state government now. Former Governor Gerald Baliles, in this same vein, has advocated a realignment of the two houses in a way that serves commonalities. He has suggested that we either increase membership in the Senate to 50, or decrease House membership to 80, producing a scenario wherein 1 Senator would represent a block of people who are represented by exactly 2 Delegates. He thinks--and I think he is right--that this arrangement would foster a closer working relationship between the Senate and the House.

Meiji Japan was driven to emulate what it thought the West was doing in every facet of society. They had observed, for example, that the West was able to carve up China into ""Spheres of Influence"", and was able to do from great distances, while they, the Japanese, had had limited success in their previous attempts to dominate the Korean peninsula, much less China. As part of the catch-up effort, she whole-heartedly entered into the Imperialist game in Asia, being treated as an equal (relative to her power) by the other powers. However, after World War I, Japan failed to recognize a fundamental shift in the attitudes of her former Imperial partners; they began a long, slow process of disengaging themselves from their former Imperial areas, from their colonies, in addition to outright stopping all expansions. Japan chose to read this as a sign that the West had lost its power and resolve, and that Japan was the rightful heir to Imperial mantle in Asia. With the deaths of many of the idealistic leaders who had led Japan's rise to international prominence, and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs, in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions from Germany, Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive Japan in the area. Having a keen grasp of the obvious, she began a policy of acceding to Japanese hegemony in the area.",stripping,20,1760

PSD managed to keep a stronghold in poor rural areas, with the help of people like Mischie. They combined blackmail, using their right of decision regarding the public funds for local leaders opposing PSD, and strong seduction of the uneducated masses, in a marvelous way.

Maybe he tried to invest in his paper, maybe he believed sincerely in his admiration for the poor innocent dead guy and his ability of earning PhDs, but using a big car and living in a big house are signs for the masses that the man is an invaluable and irreplaceable leader. Another misleading sign was his position as a University professor - he was teaching mostly at private universities, which are still ways to buy diplomas here in Romania.",voted,17,1932

Most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mitigate this threat. Instead, a menu of options may be considered, including installing infrared (IR) countermeasures on aircraft; modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures; improving airport and regional security; and strengthening missile non-proliferation efforts. Equipping aircraft with missile countermeasure systems can protect the aircraft even when operating in areas where ground-based security measures are unavailable or infeasible to implement. However, this option has a relatively high cost, between $1 million and $3 million per aircraft, and the time needed for implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing terrorist threat. Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training, altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks. However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports.",attacks,0,1914

[ applause ]d the extra $400 per child to american families this year, 2003. all together these tax reductions will help 92 million americans. and a significant part of the benefit to our economy will come within the first two years of the plan. a family of four with an income of $40,000 would receive a 96% reduction in federal income taxes. instead of paying $1,178 per year, the family would pay $45 a year. [ applause ] that means extra money in the family budget year after year. that money can cover a lot of bills. that money can help families with purchases they have been delaying. that money will be in circulation, which will be good for our economy. [ applause ] and this plan will help our small business sector. the benefits of the growth plan will come from uncreased consumer spending and, as importantly, from a lower income tax rates on the small businesses themselves. it is important for our fellow citizens to understand that most small businesses pay their business taxes at the individual rates. most small businesses are sole proprietorships, limited partnerships, are subchapter ss, and, therefore, when you reduce individual tax rates, you benefit small business formation. as a matter of fact, under this plan, some 23 million small business owners will see their taxes cut. which leaves more money for investment, more money for growth, more money for job creation. a growing economy also needs small business investment. and our tax code should encourage investment. today a small business can deduct a maximum of $25,000 in the year in which they buy equipment. we need to triple the amount that can be deducted in the year in which they buy equipment. [ applause ] so i propose to congress that they ought to limit -- limit ought to be increased to $75,000 and that limit ought to be indexed to inflation. by doing so, we promote greater investment in machinery. and when a small business bias machine that enhances their company's product divty as well as it means machinery manufacturer is likely to have more work available. more investment equals jobs. and what we are interested in in this administration is helping people who look for work find a job. [ applause ] we can also promote economic growth and job creation by removing the double tax on dividends. [ applause ] taxing corporate income once is fair. it is not fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice. the burden of double taxation falls on the millions of individuals who receive dividends. falls especially hard on seniors who receive half of all dividend income. removal of double taxation would put more money in the hands of investors. it would encourage more investment in american businesses. economists say that this plan will help our stock markets, and since half of american families own stock, the reform will help them save and help our economy grow. now, these measures were presented to congress in the first week of this year. the pro growth package was urgent in january. it's even more urgent today. [ applause ] it is important for you all to understand and for our fellow americans to understand the tax relief that i have proposed and will push for until enacted would create -- [ applause ] will create 1.4 million new jobs by the end of 2004. in two years time, this nation has experienced war, a recession and a national emergency. which has caused our government to run a deficit. the best way to reduce the deficit is with more growth in our economy, which means more revenues to our treasury, and less spending in washington, d.c. [ applause ] i am pleased that both the house and senate have passed budget resolutions that show real spending restraint. and now the congress must focus on a robust and effective growth package. we need at least $550 billion in that package because the more tax relief that goes to the american people, the more jobs we will create in this economy. [ applause ] the last few months have been a time of challenge for america. our resolve has been tested. yet we have the great resources of national strength. and national character. to overcome every challenge we face. our confidence an our optimism have never waivered. we are defending the peace of the world. we're bringing freedom to corners of the world who haven't seen freedom in years. we're all building the prosperity of our country. this is a unique moment in our history and the american people are rising to meet it. i want to thank each of you for your hard work. i want to thank each of you for the faith you have shown in this country's future. may god bless you, and may god continue to bless america.

Let me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else's lawsuits, but instead focus on his own experience.

Here's what the ""Dallas Morning News"" reported recently: ""The Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, the agency that pledges to protect the public has granted second and third chances to surgeons who are thrown out of hospitals because they botched operations. It has forgiven physicians who overlook cancerous tumors, who maimed infants or whose mistakes left women sterilized. It has refused in the last five years to revoke the license of a single doctor for committing medical errors. Thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade.""
